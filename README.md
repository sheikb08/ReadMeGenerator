# Description
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app--what is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

## Tech/Modules Used :

### [FS](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-nodejs-fs-module):
* File I/O is provided by simple wrappers around standard POSIX functions. To use this module do require('fs'). All the methods have asynchronous and synchronous forms.

* The asynchronous form always take a completion callback as its last argument. The arguments passed to the completion callback depend on the method, but the first argument is always reserved for an exception. If the operation was completed successfully, then the first argument will be null or undefined.

### [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
* Used to format and organize questions asked during the command line experience. Inquirer.js strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for Node.js (and perhaps the "CLI Xanadu").


### [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) : 
* jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

### [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) : 
* JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive.
* JavaScript(JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. 
* With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.

## Installation 
You must perform a "npm install" in the directory hosting the package file and run the index.js program from your command line.

## Usage 
This application can be used to quickly create a formatted README.md file.
